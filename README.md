# Funpedia - My blog!

A Progressive Web Application (PWA) built using Node.js and Materialize. The website has been hosted on Heroku.

Getting directed to another page??? :fearful:  
It's intended! :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:  

**The code in this repository just redirects you to my *original website*: https://funpedia.herokuapp.com (which has been developed using Node.js and Materialize as earlier mentioned) and is not the actual code.**   


### More about my blog :P  
Here, you can find most of my paintings. Well! Originally named Funpedia, this is a website (as stated in the very name of the website :P), that I built just for fun!   

There is plenty of scope for improvement and also, a lot more left to add on! I would be extremely glad to hear your feedback so that the blog can be further enhanced!
