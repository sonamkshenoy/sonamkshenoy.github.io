# Funpedia - My blog!

A Progressive Web Application (PWA) built using Node.js, Materialize and Web Sockets. The website has been hosted on Heroku.

Funpedia (name of the website) was created with an intention to build a **blog for my paintings**.  

Visit the blog: https://sonamkshenoy.github.io

**The code in this repository just redirects you to my *original website*: https://funpedia.herokuapp.com (which has been developed using Node.js, Materialize and Web Sockets as earlier mentioned) and is not the actual code.**   


## More about my blog:   
Here, you can find my collection of paintings. There's also a feature to chat online with anyone who is present at the same time on that particular page (chat page). This has been built using web sockets.

There is plenty of scope for improvement and also, a lot more left to add on! I would be extremely glad to hear your feedback so that the blog can be further enhanced!
